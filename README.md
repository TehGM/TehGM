## My programing ðŸ’»
I started programming in secondary school - roughly 11 or 12 years ago. I focus on C# - I am an ASP.NET Core developer by profession, and for hobby I like to develop libraries and bots - but I do often utilize my ASP.NET Core knowledge in many of my personal projects as well.  
I am very good-practices oriented - I try to make all of my code follow best practices where possible, and follow C# standards.

### Languages ðŸ’¬
Besides C#, I can also develop with JS, Python or Java if needed (once I look up for some syntax reminders!)
Additionally, I plan to learn Go sometime soonâ„¢.

## Other interests ðŸŽ®
I also am a gamer by hobby - gaming is what got me into programming at all! X series are my favourite - nothing like living in space.

Speaking of X series, I also am interested in science fiction and outer space. I might not do a lot of research in this field, but if something is set in space, it is guaranteed to catch my attention - and likely that I'll sink more time into it!
