## My programming ðŸ’»
I started programming in secondary school - roughly 15 or 16 years ago. I focus on C# - I am an ASP.NET Core developer by profession, and for hobby I like to develop libraries and bots - but I do often utilize my ASP.NET Core knowledge in many of my personal projects as well.  
I am very good-practices oriented - I try to make all of my code follow best practices where possible, and follow C# standards.

### Project highlights - Closed Source
- [StalcraftHQ](https://stalcrafthq.com) - a highly popular website for tracking clans, players, emissions and much more for a MMOFPS game [Stalcraft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818450/STALCRAFT_X/).  
StalcraftHQ is built with ASP.NET Core and Blazor, and is currently the main project I am working on.
- [SnipLink](https://beta.sniplink.net/) - a ASP.NET Core-based link shortener, designed to generate short links that expire after set time.

### Project highlights - Open Source
- [Wolfringo](https://github.com/TehGM/Wolfringo) - a strongly typed, extensible .NET library for building bots for WOLF (previously known as Palringo).
- [Randominator](https://github.com/TehGM/Randominator) - a fun Blazor website with random generators for random stuff, running entirely in browser thanks to Blazor.
- [fsriev](https://github.com/TehGM/fsriev) - a simple but highly customizable file watcher for Windows and Linux.
- [Einherji](https://github.com/TehGM/EinherjiBot) - a Discord bot built purely for administrative needs for me and my friends.
- [Pic Size Bot for WOLF](https://github.com/TehGM/WolfBot-Size) - a bot aiding users with submitting and moderating content for WOLF in-app games.

I also have some other public repositories - feel free to check them to see my other work!

### Languages ðŸ’¬
Besides C#, I can also develop with JS, Python or Java if needed (once I look up for some syntax reminders!)

## Other interests ðŸŽ®
#### Gaming
I also am a gamer by hobby - gaming is what got me into programming at all! 

**X series** are my favourite - nothing like living in space.  
Other games that I'd highlight as ones I really like are **Spyro** trilogy (I mean, it's literally my childhood!), **Path of Exile**, **Bullets Per Minute**, **Stellaris**, **Dyson Sphere Program**, **Escape from Tarkov** or **S.T.A.L.K.E.R** and its mods and spinoffs (like Anomaly or Stalcraft)... and ofc more!

#### Space (!)
Speaking of X series, Dyson Sphere Program and Stellaris, I also am interested in science fiction and outer space. I might not do a lot of research in this field, but if something is set in space, it is guaranteed to catch my attention - and likely that I'll sink more time into it!

And obviously, **The Expanse** is one of my top 3 favourite shows (the other being iZombie and The X-Files, but that's a different topic).  
It's also on my backlog to read... I already have the books, I probably should get to it!

#### Board Games
I am a firm believer that board games just hit different, and there's no way to reproduce that vibe on a PC screen, even on LAN parties.

I currently own **Zona**, **Deep Rock Galactic** (including all expansions) and **ISS Vangaurd**. I also already backed **S.T.A.L.K.E.R** and **EVE: War for New Eden**.

### Music? ðŸŽ¸
I am not a musician, but like everyone I like to listen to some music.  
Genre of choice? Of course metal. ðŸ¤˜  
Fav bands? Well, there's a plenty, but if I was to pick my all-time favourite, it'd be Godsmack (which ironically is more hard rock than metal).
