## My programming ðŸ’»
I started programming in secondary school - roughly 15 or 16 years ago. I focus on C# - I am an ASP.NET Core developer by profession, and for hobby I like to develop libraries and bots - but I do often utilize my ASP.NET Core knowledge in many of my personal projects as well.  
I am very good-practices oriented - I try to make all of my code follow best practices where possible, and follow C# standards.

I also run a [StalcraftHQ](https://stalcrafthq.com) - a highly popular website for tracking clans, players, emissions and much more for a MMOFPS game [Stalcraft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818450/STALCRAFT_X/).  
StalcraftHQ is built with ASP.NET Core and Blazor.

### Languages ðŸ’¬
Besides C#, I can also develop with JS, Python or Java if needed (once I look up for some syntax reminders!)

## Other interests ðŸŽ®
#### Gaming
I also am a gamer by hobby - gaming is what got me into programming at all! 

**X series** are my favourite - nothing like living in space.  
Other games that I'd highlight as ones I really like are **Spyro** trilogy (I mean, it's literally my childhood!), **Path of Exile**, **Bullets Per Minute**, **Stellaris**, **Dyson Sphere Program**, **Escape from Tarkov** or **S.T.A.L.K.E.R** and its mods and spinoffs (like Anomaly or Stalcraft)... and ofc more!

#### Space (!)
Speaking of X series, Dyson Sphere Program and Stellaris, I also am interested in science fiction and outer space. I might not do a lot of research in this field, but if something is set in space, it is guaranteed to catch my attention - and likely that I'll sink more time into it!

And obviously, **The Expanse** is one of my top 3 favourite shows (the other being iZombie and The X-Files, but that's a different topic).  
It's also on my backlog to read... I already have the books, I probably should get to it!

#### Board Games
I am a firm believer that board games just hit different, and there's no way to reproduce that vibe on a PC screen, even on LAN parties.

I currently own **Zona**, **Deep Rock Galactic** (including all expansions) and **ISS Vangaurd**. I also already backed **S.T.A.L.K.E.R** and **EVE: War for New Eden**.

### Music? ðŸŽ¸
I am not a musician, but like everyone I like to listen to some music.  
Genre of choice? Of course metal. ðŸ¤˜  
Fav bands? Well, there's a plenty, but if I was to pick my all-time favourite, it'd be Godsmack (which ironically is more hard rock than metal).
